# EFGL Project - Operational Pattern Analysis
**Project Period**: 13 May 2025 - 14 Aug 2025
**Scope**: 3 Floating Wind Foundations (WindFloat® platforms)
**Location**: Mediterranean Sea, France (Port-La Nouvelle)

---

## Executive Summary

Analysis of EFGL project execution reveals three distinct operational patterns that demonstrate **strong learning curve effects** and **opportunities for efficiency gains**. Key findings:

- **79.5% learning rate** with 36.88% overall improvement (F1→F3)
- **87% reduction** in tower section completion time (15 days → 2 days)
- **40% improvement** in per-floater preparation time (5 days → 3 days)
- **Crane utilization**: 10.8-12.4% (significant scheduling opportunity)
- **Morning start preference** for risk mitigation and weather optimization

---

## Pattern 1: Morning Start Time Preference

### Summary
EFGL demonstrates a strong preference for early morning operation starts (7-11am) to allow full working day for completion if issues arise. Team also shows **opportunistic time optimization** when tasks complete early.

### Start Time Analysis

| Activity        | F1 Start | F2 Start | F3 Start | Pattern                 | Strategic Rationale                       |
|-----------------|----------|----------|----------|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Tower Sec 1     | 10:10    | 11:00    | 07:30    | ✅ Morning (7-11am)     | Risk buffer, full day available          |
| Tower Sec 2     | 07:50    | 09:30    | 13:50    | ⚠️ Mixed (F3 afternoon) | F3: Same-day optimization (see below)    |
| Tower Sec 3     | 05:25    | 07:30    | 07:30    | ✅ Early morning        | Maximum daylight hours                   |
| Nacelle         | 16:20    | 16:50    | 15:20    | ❌ Afternoon/evening    | 🔒 Constrained - must follow Tower Sec 3 |
| Blade 1         | 07:00    | 12:30    | 11:40    | ⚠️ Mixed                | Flexible - one blade/day target          |
| Blade 2         | 06:30    | 05:40    | 08:50    | ✅ Early morning        | Flexible scheduling                      |
| Blade 3         | 06:30    | 13:00    | 07:10    | ⚠️ Mixed                | Flexible scheduling                      |

### Key Insights

**1. Tower Sections Strategy**
- **Prefer early morning starts** (5:25-11:00)
- Allows full working day for completion
- Provides buffer time if technical issues arise
- Weather windows typically better in morning

**2. Nacelle Constraint** 🔒
- **MUST be installed AFTER Tower Section 3** is complete
- Engineering requirement: No vibration damper installed
- Less control over start time → afternoon/evening starts (15:20-16:50)
- Sequencing dependency, not a scheduling choice

**3. Blade Installation Flexibility**
- Target: **One blade per day**
- Flexible start times due to independent installation
- Can adjust based on weather windows and crew availability
- Start times vary from 05:40 to 13:00

**4. F3 Tower Section 2 - Opportunistic Optimization** ✨
- Tower Section 1 F3 completed early at **12:50**
- Team seized opportunity to start Section 2 **same day at 13:50** (1 hour later)
- **Shows proactive scheduling and efficiency mindset**
- Demonstrates team's ability to capitalize on early completions
- **Not a constraint - but an optimization strategy**

**5. Overall Operational Strategy**
- ✅ **Risk mitigation**: Early starts provide buffer for unexpected delays
- ✅ **Weather optimization**: Morning often has better conditions in Mediterranean
- ✅ **Crew efficiency**: Full daylight hours available
- ✅ **Opportunistic optimization**: Capitalize on early completions when possible

### Efficiency Culture Indicator
The F3 Tower Section 2 late start (13:50) reveals an **efficiency-oriented team culture**:
- Not rigidly following "one section per day" rule
- Actively looking for opportunities to compress schedule
- Quick decision-making (only 1-hour gap between sections)
- Demonstrates learning and confidence by F3

## Pattern 3: Large Gaps Between Tower Sections (Sequencing Analysis)

### Summary
Significant idle time between operations in F1, but **progressive improvement** in scheduling efficiency across floaters. F1 shows learning phase with large gaps; F2-F3 show dramatic tightening of schedules.

### Controllable vs. Uncontrollable Factors

#### ✅ Project Team Controls (Learning Observed)

1. **Per-floater preparation**: 5d → 4d → 3d (40% improvement)
   - Time from floater arrival to first tower section
   - Specific to each floater within EFGL project
   - Positioning, checks, crane setup optimization

2. **Tower section sequencing**: 15d → 2d → 2d (87% improvement)
   - Dramatic reduction in gaps between sections
   - F3 achieved same-day double installation (Sec 1+2)
   - Clear learning curve effect

3. **Blade sequencing**: Variable, best at F3 (consecutive)
   - F1: 4 days, F2: 7 days (regression), F3: 2 days (best)
   - Shows learning is not always linear

#### 🔒 Fixed Technical Constraints (No Control)

1. **Tower Sec 3 + Nacelle same-day requirement**
   - Engineering constraint: No vibration damper installed
   - All floaters: `Sec 3 → [0d] → Nacelle` (mandatory)
   - Zero flexibility - cannot be optimized

2. **4-day gap before Blade 1** (appears consistent)
   - Observed across all floaters
   - Possible technical/safety reason
   - Equipment/crew changeover

#### 🚢 External Dependencies (No Control)

1. **Tow-out vessel availability**: 9-11 day variation
   - F1: 11 days, F2: 9 days, F3: 11 days
   - Dependent on vessel scheduling
   - Outside project team control

2. **Weather windows**
   - Mediterranean summer conditions
   - Possible factor in F1 tower section gaps
   - Blade installation weather dependency

3. **Supply chain delays**
   - Component availability
   - Equipment maintenance schedules

---

### Root Causes of Gaps (F1 Learning Phase)

**Identified Factors:**
1. **Learning curve** - First-time execution inefficiencies (resolved by F2-F3)
2. **Weather windows** - Mediterranean summer weather variability
3. **Crew availability/rotation** - Scheduling coordination
4. **Equipment maintenance** - Crane downtime requirements
5. **Logistics coordination** - Component supply chain timing
6. **Regulatory/safety holds** - Inspection periods, permits

**Evidence of Learning:**
- ✅ F1→F2: Eliminated 12-day gap to 1-day gaps
- ✅ F2→F3: Achieved same-day tower installations
- ✅ Setup time reduced from 5→3 days (40%)

## Utilization Analysis

### Crane Utilization (10-hour working days)

| Floater | Calendar Days | Crane Hours | Available Hours (10h/day) | Utilization | Improvement |
|---------|---------------|-------------|---------------------------|-------------|-------------|
| **F1**  | 39 days       | 42.25h      | 390h                      | **10.8%**   | Baseline    |
| **F2**  | 26 days       | 32.33h      | 260h                      | **12.4%**   | ↑ 15%       |
| **F3**  | 22 days       | 26.67h      | 220h                      | **12.1%**   | ↑ 12%       |

### Key Observations

1. **Very low utilization** (10-12%) indicates significant scheduling opportunity
2. **Improvement trend** F1→F2 shows learning effect
3. **F3 slight decrease** may be due to external factors (weather, vessel timing)
4. **Opportunity**: Could theoretically achieve 30-40% utilization with optimized scheduling

### Comparison: 24h vs 10h Working Day Assumption

**If calculated as 24h/day** (incorrect):
- F1: 4.5%, F2: 5.2%, F3: 5.1%

**Correct calculation (10h working day)**:
- F1: 10.8%, F2: 12.4%, F3: 12.1%

**Rationale**: Crane operations limited to ~10-hour daylight shifts, not 24-hour operations.
